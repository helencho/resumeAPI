# Resume API 

My resume in RESTful API.  

I decided to create this project for a multiple of reasons: 

- I read an MDN article on [server-side programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps) 

- I needed more experience with server-side programming 

- I wanted to get an in-depth understanding of Express 

- Simon did it first. Take a look at his [Portfolio Rest API](http://simonyo.us/#projects)
